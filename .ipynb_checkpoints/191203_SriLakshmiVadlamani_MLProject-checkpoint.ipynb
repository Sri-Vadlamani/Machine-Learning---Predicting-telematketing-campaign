    "The goal of this project is to predict the success of telemarketing calls for selling bank long-term deposits by employing several supervised machine learning models. Understanding customers' needs and developing better marketing strategies increases overall productivity of banking industry, thus reducing the expenditure on undesirable advertisements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper  [Moro et al., 2014].\n",
